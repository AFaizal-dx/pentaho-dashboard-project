# Adf-Pentaho package

This project contains the components and services to be used to integrate the Pentaho CDE dashboards into an [Alfresco Application Development Framework](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-ng2-components) application.

Considering that an Alfresco ADF application is a standard Angular application, the components should be used also without the ADF components.

## Content of the package

The package contains:

* The `adf-pentaho-dashboard` component, used to render a Pentaho CDE dashboard in an angular page. The `adf-pentaho-dashboard` component uses the `adf-pentaho-service`.
* The `adf-pentaho-service`, used as library to collect all the available services useful for the package.
